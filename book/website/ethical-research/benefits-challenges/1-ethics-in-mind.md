# 1. Research with ethics in mind

This chapter explains why it is important to devote resources to ethical processes.

This chapter also explains how including these resources in your plans from the start will make planning and managing your project easier.

## Why devote resources to ethical processes? 


Data science - like most branches of research - is expensive.
At the same time, many researchers - whether they are at universities, companies, or other institutions - face challenges in funding their research.
In challenging funding contexts, there can be a lot of pressure to cut costs.
This pressure can come externally, from the administrators of budgets, grants, and other forms of funding. 
It can also come internally: researchers can be worried about being seen to be wasting funds or making poor financial decisions in their work.

When there is pressure to cut costs, researchers may feel pressured to minimise - or drop entirely - anything that is not directly related to their direct measures of success. 
These could be journal articles, or improved performance of commercial products, for example.
Anything that takes time away from these outputs can be seen as unnecessary. 
This might include ethical analysis.
Researchers under pressure of time and resources might reduce their ethical considerations solely to what is required to pass an institutional ethics board.

* potential for unexpected harm

* loss of unexpected benefits

* lack of training for future researchers

* choosing other work over ethical work is a choice: are you sure that it is the choice that you want to be making?

> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish, however, remember to add [labels](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) to any additional headers you create to facilitate cross-referencing.

> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.
> The [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-citing.html) also contains _The Turing Way's_ recommendations for referencing and citation.

> To include an image in your writing, use the MyST directive shown below. 
> Remember to add your image to the `figures` [folder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/book/website/figures) and use the correct path, else it will not be displayed.

```{figure} ../../figures/image-name.png

```

> To include code blocks, simply enclose your code in three sets of backticks shown below.

```
def simple_function():
    pass
```

> To include an admonition or to highlight a block of text that exists slightly apart from the narrative of your section, use the directive shown below. Jupyter Book's [documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html#) has other useful examples.

```{note}
Here is a note!

## Summary

> **Add a short summary of this subchapter with key takeaways.**
> You may also recommend and link to other chapters/subchapters you want your readers to explore after reading this subchapter.


<!-- IMPORTANT!

- Use this template to create your chapter's subchapters.
- Refrain from writing very long subchapters as readers may be unwilling to read them. Rather, you should split long subchapters into smaller subchapters if necessary.
